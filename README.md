## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### 1. suricata python based GUI
*Description*: A Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed for a Suricata lab environment to monitor and analyze network security events from Suricata’s fast.log and eve.json. This tool provides real-time visibility into alerts, anomalies, and traffic patterns, making it ideal for educational labs or small-scale network security experiments.
- **Tech Stack**:
- Python: Core language.
- Tkinter: GUI framework (standard library).
- Pillow: For screenshot capability.
- **Features**:  
  - Real-time monitoring of fast.log alerts with automatic updates
  - Filtering by date, signature, and priority for lab-specific analysis
  - Anomaly detection for rare signatures and high-priority alerts
  - Clickable events to display detailed alert information
  - Screenshot functionality to capture lab observations 
- **Repo**: https://www.github.com/chuksgebi/suricata-Gui.git

2. AB-NEXUS Enterprise Network Topology
Description: A comprehensive hierarchical three-layer (Core, Distribution, Access) enterprise network design for Access Bank's Headquarters and regional branches (Ikeja and Lekki). This project incorporates Cisco Multilayer Switches, OSPF multi-area routing with ECMP load balancing, BGP for secure branch connectivity, EtherChannel for link aggregation, VLAN segmentation, security features like ACLs, and monitoring tools. It also includes a web server hosting the bank website, a central DHCP server for IP assignment and syslog logging, Cyber Observer for threat monitoring (real-time anomaly detection, compliance auditing, vulnerability scanning), and Network Controller for link monitoring (dynamic traffic steering, bandwidth allocation, fault detection).

Tech Stack:

Cisco IOS and Multilayer Switches
OSPF, BGP, EtherChannel (LACP)
VLANs, SVIs, ACLs, SPAN, NetFlow, SNMP
Cyber Observer, Network Controller
DHCP Server, Syslog, Web Server


Features:

Multi-area OSPF for internal scalability and redundancy
BGP peering for external branch connectivity with route policy control
High availability with dual core switches and ECMP
Security enhancements including ICMP control and centralized logging
Advanced monitoring with threat detection and link orchestration
Scalable design supporting cloud integration and SD-WAN
